# react-flux-todo-extra-annotation

Since i'm learning react-flux, decided to add extra annotations to their Todo example.

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux-1.1.1

## building

Refer to the actual todo example within react-flux if you want to build this for the browser.

```
stack ghci
```

However, included is a stack-ghcjs.yaml.
